{"name":"Mt-Aligner","tagline":"Open Source effort to create a Machine Translation based Alignment tool. Also known as Mount Aligner.","body":"### Welcome to MT Aligner (mount aligner)\r\nThis automatic Translation Memory and Machine Translation Engine trainer is an experimental project. The concept is based on seeding a Machine Translation Engine (SMT-based) with an unreliable corpus (the source text) and a parallel unreliable output model (target text). \r\n\r\nThe corpus files are \"auto-aligned\" using [Hunalign](https://github.com/danielvarga/hunalign) or similar tools [LF align](http://sourceforge.net/projects/aligner/) that generate information about the source and target texts--however, unlike these tools, the goal is not *only* a Translation Memory for later re-use, but a training set of data for an MT engine. \r\n\r\nEventually, a mock-training set can be generated by the MT engine and then the alignment tools used to verify/validate it. The objective is to create a reliable language model for the parallel corpora not just a useful artifact (Translation Memory).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCurrently a work in progress... You can be a contributor or guinea pig! \r\nplease send a note to @nihowma for more details. I am doing this on the side of my regular translation industry job, so if all of a sudden a passionate creator with plenty of time and talent on their hands wants to build, build, baby build! I won't be standing in the way. For the meantime this project continues.\r\n\r\n###License\r\nGNU LGPLv3; as an open source project no rights are held beyond those stated in the GNU license, feel free to expand or fork this project at will. \r\n\r\n![My Unicorn](https://github.com/unicorn.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
